# NN-From-Scratch
This Jupyter Notebook builds neural networks from scratch, starting with generating non-linear training data using the spiral_data function. It implements fundamental components such as dense layers and forward propagation using NumPy. The notebook includes a structured implementation of key neural network building blocks.
